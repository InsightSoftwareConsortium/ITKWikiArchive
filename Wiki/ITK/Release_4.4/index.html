<div class="mw-body-content mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>We are excited to announce two new ImageIO modules available in the
main repository.  The MINC ImageIO module provides a bridge to the
MINC file format, a powerful medical imaging format used by the MINC
library, another open source library with many features similar to
ITK.  The new MINC module, which has Image IO and Transform IO
capabilities, is considered experimental and must be enabled by
turning Module_ITKIOMINC ON in CMake’s configuration.  This will
automatically build the MINC library, which is now available on Mac,
Linux, and Windows.  The HDF5-based MINC2 file format is supported,
but support for the NetCDF-based MINC1 file format is not supported
because NetCDF is not distributed with ITK.
</p><p>Another new ImageIO module that expands the reach of ITK is the SCIFIO
module.  SCIFIO is a refactoring of the Bio-Formats library.  This
module provides access to a wide range of file formats encountered in
life sciences/microscopy environments.  This experimental feature is
available a Remote module; to enable it, set the Fetch_SCIFIO CMake
variable to ON.  Many improvements and fixes are ongoing for this
module; Git master is recommended for those interested in this module.
</p><p>A number of improvements were also made to DCMTK ImageIO, but this
module remains experimental on disabled by default.  To try DCMTK
ImageIO support, turn the CMake option Module_ITKIODCMTK ON.  For Unix
platforms, the supporting DCMTK library will automatically be built as
a CMake ExternalProject.  On Windows, the DCMTK library must be built
independently of the ITK build system.  Then, specify the location to
the external build after setting the CMake option ITK_USE_SYSTEM_DCMTK
ON.
</p><p>A number of performance improvements were made to QuadEdgeMesh
processing and memory copy functions.  A new ImageScanlineIterator is
available.  This iterator can be used in many of the cases where an
ImageRegionIterator is applied, but it has better performance.
</p><p>The approach to split image regions for parallel processing is no
longer hard coded to make multiple options available.
</p><p>An API design change was started to improve the implied functionality
of the GetObject methods.  The non-const “GetObjectMacro” has been
replaced with a “GetModifiableObjectMacro” that will result in a
GetModifiableXXX method instead of a GetXXX method.  This makes the
non-const nature of the method and the circumvention of pipeline
update semantics explicit for both the code author and those reading
the class API.  This was implemented in a backwards compatible way,
and it will only be enforced if ITK_FUTURE_LEGACY_REMOVE is defined.
</p><p>Support for the Google Double Conversion library was added to improve
the reading and writing of double values as ASCII text with the
intention to improve the precision of the text transform file format’s
serialization.
</p><p>It is now easier to identify filter inputs by both a string name or an
integer index.  The internal methods to store and retrieve inputs by
either string or index was correspondingly refactored, and performance
was also improved.
</p><p>JPEG ImageIO now writes and reads image spacing in a manner similar to
the TIFF ImageIO.
</p><p>An extensive amount of code cruft was removed and coding style was
made more consistent; ITK gets more stylish and classy with every
release!
</p><p>The ExternalData method to store large testing data outside of the Git
repository is now in upstream CMake 2.8.11.  Our internal version has
been updated to the improved version in CMake.
</p><p>The minimum CMake required version was bumped to 2.8.8 on Windows and
2.8.5 otherwise.  This may be increased even higher in the near future
to ensure all CMake features utilized operate correctly.
</p><p>Known assertion failures occur when compiled under Visual Studio in
the Debug configuration.  This will be fixed in 4.4.1.  If this has a
significant negative impact on your work, please consider contributing
a Nightly dashboard build under this configuration.  As previously
scheduled, Visual Studio 2005 is no longer be supported.
</p><p>Support for building against system third party libraries continues to
improve.  Further improvements are expected for version 4.5.
</p><p>All tests are now passing again on the Nightly big-endian dashboard system.
</p><p>InsightApplications (ITKApps) has seen fixes in the FLTK superbuild
and the TCL wrapped applications.
