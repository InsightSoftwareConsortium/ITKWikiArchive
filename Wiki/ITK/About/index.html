<p>The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and segmentation. <i>Segmentation</i> is the process of identifying and classifying data found in a digitally sampled representation. Typically the sampled representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI scanners. <i>Registration</i> is the task of aligning or developing correspondences between data. For example, in the medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to combine the information contained in both.
</p><p>ITK is implemented in C++. ITK is cross-platform, using the <a class="external text" href="http://www.cmake.org/" rel="nofollow">CMake</a> build environment to manage the compilation process. In addition, an automated wrapping process generates interfaces between C++ and interpreted programming languages such as <a class="external text" href="http://java.sun.com/" rel="nofollow">Java</a> and <a class="external text" href="http://www.python.org/" rel="nofollow">Python</a>. This enables developers to create software using a variety of programming languages. ITK's C++ implementation style is referred to as <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming" rel="nofollow">generic programming</a> (i.e., using templated code). Such C++ templating means that the code is highly efficient, and that many software problems are discovered at compile-time, rather than at run-time during program execution.
</p><p>Because ITK is an open-source project, developers from around the world can use, debug, maintain, and extend the software. ITK uses a model of software development referred to as <a class="external text" href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/" rel="nofollow">extreme programming</a>. <i>Extreme programming</i> collapses the usual software creation methodology into a simultaneous and iterative process of design-implement-test-release. The key features of extreme programming are communication and testing. Communication among the members of the ITK community is what helps manage the rapid evolution of the software. Testing is what keeps the software stable. In ITK, an extensive testing process (using <a class="external text" href="http://www.cdash.org" rel="nofollow">CDash</a>) is in place that measures the quality on a daily basis. The <a class="external text" href="http://public.kitware.com/dashboard.php?name=itk" rel="nofollow">ITK Testing Dashboard</a> is posted continuously reflecting the quality of the software.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_History_of_ITK">The History of ITK</span></h2>
<p>In 1999 the US National Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health awarded a three-year contract to develop an open-source  registration and segmentation toolkit, which eventually came to be known  as the Insight Toolkit (ITK). ITK's NLM Project Manager was Dr. Terry  Yoo, who coordinated the six prime contractors who made up the Insight  Software Consortium. These consortium members included the three  commercial partners GE Research, Kitware Inc., and MathSoft  (the company name is now Insightful); and the three academic partners  University of North Carolina (UNC), University of Tennessee (UT), and  University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). The Principle Investigators for  these partners were, respectively, Bill Lorensen with Jim Miller at GE Research, Will  Schroeder at Kitware, Vikram Chalana at Insightful, Stephen Aylward with Luis Ibanez at UNC (Luis is now at Kitware), Ross Whitaker with Josh  Cates at UT (both now at Utah), and Dimitri Metaxas at UPenn (now at Rutgers). In addition, several subcontractors rounded out the consortium including  Peter Raitu at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, Celina Imielinska and Pat  Molholt at Columbia University, Jim Gee at UPenn's Grasp Lab, and George  Stetten at University of Pittsburgh.
