STYLE:  Reworked the internal typedefs to follow ITK standards, consistently name and expose those types at all layers of the class heirarchy, distinguish between typedefs refering to a subclasses interface and it's concrete type, and never traverse the class heirarchy more than one level to get the necessary typedefs.  STYLE: Re-organized the derived network types so that they are consistent, documented the required ordering proceedure to create a valid network, and added itkExceptionMacro statements to provide more meaningful comments when a network is not properly constructed before attempting to initialize.  STYLE:  Consolidated duplicate ivars in MultilayerNetwork (i.e. when an ivar is a std::vector, prefer to use std::vector::size() rather than a separate ivar that must be the size of the vector).

Code/Review/itkQuadEdgeMeshLineCell
    ENH: first results using callgrind on itkVTKPolyDataReaderTest using QuadEdgeMesh showed that more than 50% of the time was spend in the QuadEdgeMeshCell destructor calling Disconnect(). Disconnect() is only needed when the user wants to delete an isolated Edge while keeping the QuadEdge structure valid for further usage. It is thus not required when the mesh release the memory of all the cells. It will be now assumed that the user will call Disconnect() beforehand when needed. It improves the test speed by a factor 2, and the destruction of a mesh speed by a factor 30.
